# Power_Calc
Project Title: Power Pro - Casio fx-82ES Emulator
A web-based scientific calculator inspired by the classic Casio fx-82ES PLUS. This project marks my first step into the world of web development and programming, originally built during my 9th-grade year.

🚀 The Journey

This project holds a special place in my portfolio as my "Hello World" to complex logic.
The Inspiration: I wanted to recreate the physical calculator I used in school every day using only code.
The Evolution: What started as a single-file HTML project 7 years ago has been refined to showcase modern best practices, including cleaner JavaScript logic and structured styling.

✨ Features

Scientific Functions: Support for Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), Logarithms, and Square Roots.
Natural Display: Designed to mimic the Natural-V.P.A.M. interface of Casio calculators.
Memory Functions: Includes Ans (Answer memory) and M+ (Memory add) functionality.
Retro UI: A pixel-perfect CSS recreation of the physical fx-82ES hardware.

🛠️ Built With

HTML5: Semantic structure for the calculator interface.
CSS3: Custom styling using grids and borders to achieve the hardware look.
JavaScript (ES6): Logic for mathematical processing and DOM manipulation.

📈 Refactoring & Improvements

Since its original creation, I have updated the project to reflect professional standards:
Removed Unsafe Code: Replaced eval() with a more secure calculation logic to prevent script injection.
Modularization: Separated the code into dedicated .html, .css, and .js files for better maintainability.
Fixed Legacy Bugs: Resolved scope issues in trigonometric functions where variables were not properly defined.
Responsiveness: Adjusted the layout to ensure it remains functional on mobile devices.

🔧 Installation & Usage
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/power-pro-calculator.git
Open index.html in any modern web browser.

👨‍💻 Author's Note
"Looking back at this code reminds me of where I started. It represents my early interest in solving complex UI challenges and my dedication to learning the fundamentals of JavaScript before moving on to modern frameworks."
